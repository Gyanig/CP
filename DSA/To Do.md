Sorting Algorithms

1. Find a permutation that causes worst case of Merge Sort (Write a brute force algo to find worst case for any sorting algo) 
2. Using Coq or Isabelle/HOL (functional programing for mathematical proofing) for analysing stability of algorithms like sorting ( never written script in Coq or Isabelle)
3. Writing stable Quicksort 
4. Hoare's Scheme(more efficient comaprisions) Vs Lomuto's Scheme 
5. Comparisons involved in Modified Quicksort Using Merge Sort Tree/Persistent Segment Tree/Fenwick Tree (Tree topic not covered)
6. Range Order Statistics for finding median
7.
